## MVVM
MVVM (Model view ViewModel) is a design pattern that is recommended by Google. 
A typical Android app contains multiple app components, including activities, fragments, services, content providers, and broadcast receivers. As Android apps grow in size, it's important to define an architecture that allows the app to scale, increases the app's robustness, and makes the app easier to test. An app architecture defines the boundaries between parts of the app and the responsibilities each part should have. In order to meet the needs mentioned above, you should design your app architecture to follow a few specific principles.

## ROOM
The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. In particular, Room provides the following benefits:

* Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
* Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
* Streamlined database migration paths.
